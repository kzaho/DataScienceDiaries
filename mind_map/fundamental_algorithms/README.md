# Fundamental Algorithms 🧮🔍
Welcome to the Fundamental Algorithms section of DataScienceDiaries. This section is dedicated to fundamental machine learning algorithms, their implementation, and case studies. Each algorithm is covered in detail, helping you to understand the theoretical background and practical application.

## What's Inside? 📁
In this section, you will find a separate folder for each algorithm. Each folder contains detailed explanations, code implementations, example use cases, related resources, and performance metrics.

## Algorithms Covered 🎯
### 1. Linear Regression 📈
Linear regression is one of the most basic types of regression in machine learning. The algorithm predicts a real-valued output based on one or more input features.

### 2. Logistic Regression 📊
Logistic regression is used when the dependent variable is binary. Despite its name, it's a classification algorithm.

### 3. Decision Tree Learning 🌳
Decision Trees are a type of Supervised Machine Learning where the data is split according to certain conditions, leading to a set of decision rules.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM) ⚙️
Support Vector Machine is a powerful, yet flexible supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.

### 5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) 🏘️
k-NN is a type of instance-based learning where the function is approximated locally and all computation is deferred until classification.

## How to Use This Section 📚
To get the most out of this section, start with understanding the theoretical underpinning of each algorithm. Once you're comfortable with the theory, explore the Python code implementation, and examine the use cases and performance metrics.
