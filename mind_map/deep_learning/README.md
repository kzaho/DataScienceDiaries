## Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning

The first course in the specialization introduces the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning. You will learn about the technological trends driving the rise of deep learning, build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks, and understand how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks. You will also explore the key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture, and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

In the second course, you will delve into the black box of deep learning to understand the processes that drive performance and systematically generate good results. By the end of this course, you will be equipped with best practices to train and develop test sets, analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications, use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, and be proficient in hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking. You will also learn to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

## Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects

The third course teaches you how to structure a successful machine learning project, with plenty of opportunities to practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. You will learn how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, prioritize strategies for reducing errors, understand complex ML settings, and apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

## Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks

In this fourth course, you will explore the fascinating world of computer vision and its diverse applications, such as autonomous driving, face recognition, reading radiology images, and more. You will learn to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks, and apply these networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.

## Course 5: Sequence Models

The final course focuses on sequence models and their exciting applications such as speech recognition, music synthesis, chatbots, machine translation, natural language processing (NLP), and more. By the end of this course, you will be able to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs. You will also gain experience with natural language processing and Word Embeddings, and use HuggingFace tokenizers and transformer models to solve different NLP tasks.
