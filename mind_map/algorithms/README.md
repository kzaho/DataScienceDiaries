# Algorithms 🧮🔍
Welcome to the Algorithms section of DataScienceDiaries. This section delves into key areas of machine learning, focusing on different types of algorithms, each having its unique purpose and application. Classification, Clustering, Regression, and Dimensionality Reduction - we cover them all!

## What's Inside? 📁
Within each sub-section, you'll find a detailed exploration of various algorithms, their theoretical foundations, Python code implementations, and insightful case studies. Whether you're new to these concepts or want to brush up on your knowledge, this section has got you covered.

## Sub-Sections 🎯
### 1. Classification Algorithms 🏷️
Classification is a type of supervised learning where the output is a category. Dive into algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and more.

### 2. Clustering Algorithms 🌐
Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that separates data points into several specific bunches or clusters, such that the data points in the same cluster are more similar to other data points in the same cluster and dissimilar to the data points in other clusters. Discover algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and more.

### 3. Regression Algorithms 📈
Regression is a type of supervised learning where the output is a real value. Understand key regression techniques like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Polynomial Regression, and more.

### 4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques 📉
Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. Explore techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-SNE, Autoencoders, and more.

## How to Use This Section 📚
