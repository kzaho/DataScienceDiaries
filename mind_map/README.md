# Mind-Map 🧠🗺️
Welcome to the Mind-Map section of DataScienceDiaries. This is your go-to hub for all resources, links, and tools that I've found incredibly useful throughout my data science journey. Organized in a systematic way, this section allows you to navigate through the vast world of data science with ease.

## How It Works 🔍
This Mind-Map is structured into different categories, each focusing on a key area of data science. Under each category, you will find various sub-topics along with corresponding resources. Whether you are just beginning your data science journey or are an experienced professional looking for some specific resources, this mind-map is for you!

## Categories 📚
### 1. Data Science Theory 📚
Get to grips with the foundational principles, theories, and concepts of data science that underpin all techniques and methodologies.<br>
